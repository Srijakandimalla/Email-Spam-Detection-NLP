 Project Overview:
 This project implements an Email Spam Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning.
 The system classifies emails into spam or not spam by analyzing the textual content of the emails.
 
 Dataset:
 The dataset used contains labeled emails as spam or ham (non-spam). 
 Each email includes text data that is preprocessed and used to train the model.
 
 Features:
 - Text preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lowercasing, punctuation removal
 - Vectorization: Convert text into numerical format using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer
 - Model: Machine learning classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
 - Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
   
 Installation:
 1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/srijakandimalla/Email-Spam-Detection-NLP.git
 2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd Email-Spam-Detection-NLP
 3. Install required Python libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
 4. Download NLTK data:
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('punkt')

Usage:
1. Open Google Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click File â†’ Upload Notebook and upload `Email-Spam-Detection-NLP.ipynb`.
3. Upload the dataset (e.g., `spam.csv`) to Colab:
   - Click the folder icon on the left sidebar
   - Click the Upload icon to add your dataset
4. Run all cells sequentially:
   - Data loading
   - Preprocessing
   - Model training
   - Evaluation
5. View the results in the notebook (accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report).
    
 Results:
 The implemented model achieves high accuracy in classifying spam emails.
